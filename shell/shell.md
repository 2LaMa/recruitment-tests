## Shell scripting

### Level z
You notice that your colleague does the same action in his/her terminal every day. Help her/him by writing a shell script.

**Instructions:**
* create a shell script in the level-z directory which do the following:
    * Create a directory with the username like the following : `foobar-folder` (here foobar is an example) 
    * Create a .gitkeep file in the newly create directory.
    * Change the shell working directory.

**hint:**
* use `whoami` to print username
